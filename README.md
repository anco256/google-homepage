This is y first project in the microverse-odin pre-coursework
I used my previous knowledge of html and css to create and style a google.com homepage
I have not used any javascript in this project
Through the 4 hours working on this project i had to refresh my knowledge of html and css thanks to websites like www.w3schools.com, www.tutorialspoint.com, www.teamtreehouse.com among many others.
